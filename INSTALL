Cisco SFP statistics for cacti (c) 2007-2008 sodium

INSTALLATION :                                                                                                                                                                                       
1. copy cisco_sfp.xml to [$cacti_home]/resources/script_server directory
2. copy ss_65xx_sfp.php to [$cacti_home]/scripts directory
3. import the following template (within cacti)
  - cacti_data_query_cisco_65xx_sfp_statistics.xml 
4. add Cisco - 65xx - SFP statistics to your catalyst host template 
or add it to the "Associated Data Queries" in the devices list.

That's it...

Note: if your are running the thold plugin you should patch it (thold 
baseline function can't handle negative numbers (you do NOT have to patch 
if you only do high/low watermark checking.

I have included the path file for thold. (v0.3.9)
to appy patch: cacti@nms:/usr/share/cacti/plugins/thold$ patch -p0 < thold_functions-0.3.9.patch

Assumptions made within the code:
- When the script can not read the value from the SFP -40 (dBm) is returned
- snmp_port = 161
- snmp_timeout = 5000 ms
